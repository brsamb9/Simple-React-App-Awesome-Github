# React-Native-App-Awesome-Github


## inspired by the many awesome repositories https://github.com/topics/awesome <br> 
### Purpose: access 'awesome' repositories of helpful research/resource links about a given topic.

Very basic app - Learning mobile development by projects.  
<br> 
The front-end uses the react-native framework with Github API v3 calls. 
<br><br>
The app so far is rather simplistic, consiting of search filter, basic navigation and api calls.
App was done out of curosity, no plans to continue but certaintly can be much improved. 
- E.g. will have a back-end to store user and their favourites for quicker access.
