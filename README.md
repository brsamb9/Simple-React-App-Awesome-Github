# React-Native-App-Awesome-Github


## inspired by the many awesome repositories - the premise is that these 'awesome' repositories are containers of helpful research/resource links about a given topic.

Very basic app - Learning mobile development by projects.  
<br> 
The front-end uses the react-native framework with Github API v3 calls. 
<br><br>
The app so far is rather simplistic, consiting of basic navigation and api calls.
App was done out of curosity, no plans to continue but certaintly can be much improved. 
- E.g. will have a back-end to store user and their favourites for quicker access.
