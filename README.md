# WIP-React-Native-App-Awesome-Github


## inspired by the many awesome repositories - the premise is that these 'awesome' repositories are containers of helpful research/resource links about a given topic.

Learning mobile development by projects.

The front-end uses the react-native framework with Github API v3 calls. 
<br><br>
The app so far is rather simplistic, consiting of basic navigation and api calls.
Later app iterations will have a back-end to store user and their favourites for quicker access.
And to refactor the code to make it more modular.
